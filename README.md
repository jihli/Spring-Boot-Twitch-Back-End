**Key Contributions and Achievements:**

- **Frontend Development:**  
  Designed and implemented a highly interactive and user-friendly web interface using **React.js** and **Ant Design**. Focused on creating a seamless user experience with responsive design principles to ensure accessibility across devices.

- **Backend Engineering:**  
  Built **RESTful APIs** using **Java Servlets**, enabling efficient communication between the frontend and backend. Integrated the **Twitch API** to fetch live data, which was processed and stored in a **MySQL database** for enhanced performance and data persistence.

- **Authentication and User Features:**  
  Implemented secure **login/logout functionality** using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication. Added features like **favorite collection management**, allowing users to save and revisit their preferred Twitch resources.

- **Recommendation System:**  
  Researched and implemented multiple recommendation algorithms. Leveraged game metadata from Twitch resources to build a **content-based recommendation system**, enhancing the user experience by delivering tailored suggestions.

- **Cloud Deployment:**  
  Deployed the application on **AWS EC2**, ensuring high availability, stability, and scalability. Configured the cloud environment for continuous deployment and fault tolerance.
